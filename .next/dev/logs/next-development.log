[00:00:09.903] Browser WARN    Clerk: The "signInFallbackRedirectUrl" prop ("http://localhost:3000/dashboard") has priority over the legacy "afterSignInUrl" (or "redirectUrl") ("http://localhost:3000/dashboard"), which will be completely ignored in this case.

[00:00:09.903] Browser INFO    🔒 Clerk:
The <SignIn/> component cannot render when a user is already signed in, unless the application allows multiple sessions. Since a user is signed in and this application only allows a single session, Clerk is redirecting to the `afterSignIn` URL instead.
